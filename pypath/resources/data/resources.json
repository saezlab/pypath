      "functional links were specified. This follows the rules used for representation of",
      "pathways in Science’s STKE (S1). Links may be activating, inhibitory or neutral.",

      "interaction was validated by a reference from the primary literature (1202 papers were",

      "References are captured at three levels. First, each pathway as a whole",

      "pathway. For metabolic pathways, a textbook reference is usually sufficient. Second,",

      "the reactions represented in the pathway diagram.",
      "\n There are three major properties that make this infrastructure differ from",
      "other pathway curation systems, such as from Reactome and EcoCyc. First, the pathway",
      "diagrams are drawn with CellDesigner software. There are two advantages to using",
      "CellDesigner. First, controlled graphical notations are used to draw the pathway diagram,",

      "one-to-one correspondence with the ontological representation of the pathways stored in",
      "the back-end. The second property is that the scope of the pathway is defined",
      "first based on literature, and pathway components (proteins, genes, RNAs) are",
      "treated as ontology terms, or molecule classes, rather than specific instances. This",
      "means that multiple proteins from the same organism or different organisms can",
      "potentially play the same given role in a pathway. The advantage is that the work flow is",
      "more similar to the thinking process of the biologists who are the users of our",

      "designed to be simple enough to be used directly by bench biologists after a brief",

      "curators, who of course cannot be experts in all areas of biology. The current set of",

      "databases tend to annotate physical entities with different identifier types (e.g. some",

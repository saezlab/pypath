Therefore, we prepared cell-free supernatants of P. goldsteinii kh35 cultures grown in RPMI medium and investigated its ability to affect the activation of the MyD88-dependent signalling pathway. Using THP-1 monocytic cells exposed to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, we found that P. goldsteinii kh35 supernatant reduced the expression of MyD88, the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-¦ÊB) and subsequent tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-¦Á mRNA expression. In contrast, supernatant from A. onderdonkii kh33 strongly activated NF-¦ÊB in THP-1 cells.

CARD9 promotes recovery from colitis by promoting interleukin (IL)-22 production, and Card9?/? mice are more susceptible to colitis. The microbiota is altered in Card9?/? mice, and transfer of the microbiota from Card9?/? to wild-type, germ-free recipients increases their susceptibility to colitis. The microbiota from Card9?/? mice fails to metabolize tryptophan into metabolites that act as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands. Intestinal inflammation is attenuated after inoculation of mice with three Lactobacillus strains capable of metabolizing tryptophan or by treatment with an AHR agonist. Reduced production of AHR ligands is also observed in the microbiota from individuals with IBD, particularly in those with CARD9 risk alleles associated with IBD. Our findings reveal that host genes affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota, altering the production of microbial metabolites and intestinal inflammation",,

Antibiotic-induced changes in the abundance of individual groups of intestinal microbiota dramatically altered the host's metabolism. Hierarchical clustering of dissimilarities separated the levels of 284 identified metabolites from treated vs. untreated rats; 193 were altered by the antibiotic treatments with a tendency towards decreased metabolite levels. Catabolism of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine was the most affected pathway comprising 33 affected metabolites. Vancomycin-treated rats were administered amino acid metabolites prior to ischemia/reperfusion studies. Oral or intravenous pretreatment of rats with these amino acid metabolites abolished the decrease in infarct size conferred by vancomycin. Cardioprotection by vancomycin is mediated by activation of pro-survival kinases Akt, p42/44 MAPK and p38 MAPK, as well as activation of KATP channels, classical mediators and effectors of pharmacologic cardioprotection.

Gut commensal microbiota transforms primary bile acids to secondary bile acids which are then mostly absorbed by terminal ileum and colon with a few being excreted in stool.Among these secondary bile acids, TDCA is known to be procarcinogenic.To determine potential association of microbiota with metabolites, we performed correlation analysis between bacteria and metabolites by partial Spearman correlation. We observed that E. lenta had the most positive correlation with TDCA.E. lenta possesses the ability to deconjugate primary bile acids and expresses bile acid epimerising enzymes 3¦Â-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3¦Â-HSDH); hence, it participates in secondary bile acids synthesis and influences the level of TDCA in stool.",Cigarette smoke exposure;colorectal cancer, ÎÞ;DOID:9256

Based on HYA yield, we selected L. salivarius (JCM1044, JCM1042, and JCM1231) as the HYA (+) strain and L. johnsonii (JCM1022 and JCM8791) and L.acidophilus (JCM1229) as HYA (?) strains and confirmed their intestinal-bacterial colonization. Five weeks after colonization, we found that the fecal HYA levels in HYA (+)-colonized mice were significantly higher than that in GF mice, with no discernable change in this level observed between groups. After feeding an HFD to Lactobacillus-colonized 4-week-old mice for 12 weeks, we found that body weight during growth and fat mass at 16 weeks of age in HYA (+)-colonized mice significantly decreased as compared with those in HYA (?)-colonized mice. Similar to our observations in HYA-supplemented HFD-fed mice, plasma glucose levels in HYA (+)-colonized mice were also significantly lower than those in HYA (?)-colonized mice (Fig. 7c), whereas total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were similar between these groups. Moreover, GLP-1 levels were significantly higher in HYA (+)-colonized mice relative to those in HYA (?)-colonized mice (Fig. 7f), whereas plasma insulin levels in HYA ( + )-colonized mice were significantly lower than those in HYA (?)-colonized mice (Fig. 7g). In addition, we found significantly decreased adipose Tnf¦Á expression and increased fecal triglycerides in HYA (+)-colonized mice relative to these levels in HYA (?)-colonized mice, and that glucose clearance as assessed by OGTT was improved in HYA (+)-colonized mice as compared with HYA (?)-colonized mice. Furthermore, cecal HYA levels in HYA (+)-colonized mice were significantly higher than those in GF and HYA (?)-colonized mice and similar to those in conventionally raised mice.Therefore, we found that HYA-producing gut microbial Lactobacilli improved metabolic conditions.
